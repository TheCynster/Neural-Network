# Neural-Network
This is the Neural Network that I made with the help of Tariq Rashid's book "Make Your Own Neural Network"

*I could not add the MNIST dataset because the files were too large

*This project is a product of a tutorial and is not origional

<b>What I learned</b>
<ul>
<li>Python basics and some functions from the NumPy library</li>
<li>The basics of neural networks and deep learning</li>
<li>How to make a github repository and push commits and how to remove files from a commit</li>
</ul>
